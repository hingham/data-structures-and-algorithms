#Trees & Binary Search Trees


##Description: Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
Create a BinaryTree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
At no time should an exception or stack trace be shown to the end user. Catch and handle any such exceptions and return a printed value or operation which cleanly represents the state and either stops execution cleanly, or provides the user with clear direction and output.

Create a BinarySearchTree class
Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

#Challenge:
##For each class, create the specified methods above. Write three tests for each class method defined. Use recursion to traverse the trees. 

#Approach & Efficiency
#Create a class for a new node that includes a constructor. Create a class BinaryTree, and a class BinarySearchTree that extends BinaryTree. Use recursive methods to write all functions to print preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder. Use recursion to insert values, and check if a value is contained.

# Tests:
Assertions: 
Inserts new node that has a vale and a next property. New nodes will be inserted at the end with a next property equal to null.
Search through all values when includes propety is called to determine if there is a value included in the node list and returns the correct boolean value.
Correcly prints out all the values of the linked list as an array.
