# Reverse an Array
##Using no JavaScript methods, we reversed an array by creating a new arary that holds the reverse of the input array with a for loop and a counter.

##Challenge 
###This challenge asks the developer to produce the reverse of a given array without JavaScript methods. 

##Approach & Efficiency: 
###I did this by returning a new array. First I declare an empty array and a counter. I then use a for loop to loop through the array starting with the last index. I increment the counter, starting at zero, each time the for loop iterates. Inside the for loop I assign the newArray value, starting at the first index, with the value of the input Array, starting with the last index.
